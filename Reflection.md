# 📘 Reflection

**🧠 What I Learned**

**Building this FuelEU Compliance Dashboard helped me deeply understand:**

**✅ Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**

    Separation of domain logic from framework code

    Importance of inversion of control

    Keeping React, Express, and Prisma isolated in adapter layers


**✅ FuelEU Maritime Regulation Concepts**

    GHG intensity calculations

    Compliance Balance (CB) formula

    Energy conversion → 41,000 MJ/ton

    Banking & pooling constraints (Articles 20 & 21)

    Real-world sustainability + maritime regulation engineering

**✅ Full-Stack System Design**

    Dockerized Postgres setup

    Prisma as a typed ORM

    React + Tailwind modular UI structure

    REST API structure for compliance workflows

## ⚙️ Efficiency Gains From AI-Agents

| Task                            | Benefit                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Scaffolding folder structure    | Saved setup time             |
| Generating Prisma models        | Faster DB design             |
| React UI boilerplate            | Faster prototyping           |
| Debug help via terminal prompts | Reduced troubleshooting time |
| Clarifying regulation math      | Lower cognitive load         |

## 🛠️ Where I Still Had to Think

| Area                          | Why                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Compliance math               | Needed accuracy against EU spec               |
| Banking & pooling constraints | Sensitive economic logic                      |
| Handling ESM/CJS issues       | AI made mistakes, required manual fix         |
| Docker & environment setup    | Path issues & runtime errors needed debugging |

## 🚧 Improvements for Next Time

| Improvement                          | Reason                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| More automated testing               | Strengthen reliability      |
| Better prompt planning upfront       | Reduce re-generation loops  |
| Use structured architecture diagrams | Track module boundaries     |
| Earlier environment setup            | Avoid late-stage fix stress |

## 🎯 Final Thought

This project taught me a production-grade workflow with AI agents.
Not just coding faster — but coding responsibly, validating logic, and understanding the domain.

AI boosted my productivity, but engineering judgment delivered correctness.
